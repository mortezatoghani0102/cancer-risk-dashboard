# Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

![Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26413235/149544435-01f5a7e3-b3c1-4578-8686-353818e32e85.png)

##  Overview

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to accurately classify breast cancer tumors as either **malignant (ÿ®ÿØÿÆ€åŸÖ)** or **benign (ÿÆŸàÿ¥‚ÄåÿÆ€åŸÖ)** based on diagnostic measurements. Early and accurate detection of breast cancer is crucial for improving patient prognosis and survival rates. This project aims to leverage machine learning to create a reliable diagnostic tool that can assist medical professionals in making faster and more accurate classifications.

The entire workflow, from data exploration to final model evaluation, is documented in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook (`Breast_Cancer_Analysis.ipynb`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project follows a standard data science workflow:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial analysis was performed to understand the data's structure, distribution, and correlations between features. This step helped in identifying key characteristics of the dataset.

2.  **Data Preprocessing:** The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Feature scaling (`StandardScaler`) was applied to normalize the data, which is crucial for distance-based algorithms like SVM and helps with the convergence of Logistic Regression.

3.  **Model Selection & Training:** Three different classification algorithms were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation:
    * Logistic Regression
    * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    * Random Forest

4.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The best-performing model from the initial evaluation (`Random Forest`) was selected for further optimization using `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.

5.  **Final Evaluation:** The tuned model was then evaluated on the unseen test dataset to measure its real-world performance using metrics like Accuracy, AUC, Precision, and Recall.

## üìä Results

### Baseline Model Comparison
The baseline performance of the three models was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation on the training set. The results clearly indicated that Random Forest was the strongest candidate for further tuning.

| Model                  | Mean Accuracy (CV) |
| :--------------------- | :----------------: |
| Logistic Regression    | 97.14%             |
| Support Vector Machine | 97.36%             |
| **Random Forest** | **97.58%** |

### Final Model Performance
The final model, a tuned **Random Forest Classifier**, achieved excellent performance on the test set.

-   **Test Accuracy:** **97.37%**
-   **Test AUC Score:** **0.998**

#### Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix below shows the model's predictions on the test set. It correctly identified all malignant cases and only misclassified a few benign cases.

#### ROC Curve
The ROC curve demonstrates the model's outstanding ability to distinguish between the two classes, with an AUC close to 1.
